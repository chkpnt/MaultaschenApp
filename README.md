# MaultaschenApp

This Xcode project was used as a demonstrator for the Meetup of the Mobile Maultaschen on [April 09, 2019](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/mobile-maultaschen/events/259385572/).

## Some notes about the demonstrator

* I know, the UI is ugly as night.
* Do not use this structure / project as a blue print.
* I've used [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) as a dependency manager. Just run `carthage build --platform ios` to build the dependencies.
* Regarding [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift):
  * Initially, I wanted to have the usage of `R.swift` switchable to underline its advantages.
  * This is why the compiler condition `USE_R` exists in some places.
  * But that became too cumbersome for me, so not every usage of `R.swift` is wrapped into the compiler condition.
  * Removing `USE_R` from `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` will hence lead to compiler errors.
* Regarding [SwiftyMocky](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky):
  * In the documentation of SwiftyMocky, only one `mocky.yml` is used and the mocks are placed into the target under test.
  * In my opinion, the mocks needed by a test target should be part of the test target. And the test target should declare, which mocks are needed.
  * Therefore, I'm working with three different `SwiftyMocky.yml` for the three targets `MaultaschenAppTests`, `MaultaschenDataTests` and `MaultaschenDomainTests`.
  * I had issues with that setup: Sometimes the wrong `Mock.generated.swift` were generated for some targets, regardless of whether the mocks were generated by a build phase script or by running `sourcery` in watch mode. Hence I've used [`generate-mocks.sh`](generate-mocks.sh), which worked for me.
  * I do not recommend to integrate the mock generation in the build phases: This will slow down your build time as soon as your project reaches a reasonable size.
